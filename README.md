An intelligent voice-based assistant designed to help visually impaired users interact with technology more easily. This project leverages speech recognition, natural language processing (NLP), and text-to-speech to provide an accessible, hands-free experience.

🌟 Features

🎙️ Voice Command Recognition — Understands and responds to spoken commands.

🔊 Text-to-Speech Output — Converts responses and information into clear, natural speech.

🧭 Smart Assistance — Can answer questions, provide directions, read text, and more.

🌐 Web Integration — Retrieves information from the internet using APIs.

⚙️ Cross-Platform — Built using Node.js and web technologies for easy deployment.
